Lab Assignment 4 - Redux Blog Front End  
May 3, 2017  

EXTRA CREDIT -- for extra credit I implemented input validation for the creation of new blog posts, such that text had to be input for the title, tags, and content fields, and a valid URL had to be input for the cover URL field. 

This lab utilized Redux to maintain state globally for the most part. We connected Redux with React in order to develop a blog application. We used the Axios API calls in order to update the server side based on updates, creations, and deletes on the front end. We used actions and reducers as well as a global state store in tandem with react components in order to complete a functioning blog component.
